Have you ever noticed that the CTC that was offered to you during the hiring process and the amount you are getting in-hand has a considerable difference? 

Before joining any organisation, newcomers generally have a misconception that the CTC that is offered and the in-hand salary will be the same.

CTC (Cost to Company) and in-hand salary are two widespread terms in the Indian job landscape.

In reality, your in-hand salary is part of the CTC or the salary package that also includes various other deductions. Therefore, the salary you receive at the month-end significantly differs from what the company offers you during the hiring process.

**CTC**  ( Cost to Company) is form from **direct benefits** (Sum paid to an employee on a yearly basis, i.e. take-home salary, subject to government taxes. i.e., Basic salary, DA, HRA etc.), **indirect benefits** (Amount, the employer, pays on behalf of the employee .i.e., Insurance, food coupon, Interest free loans ), and **saving contributions** (Saving schemes the employee is entitled to. i.e., EPF, Gratuity, Superannuation).

**In-hand or net salary** (Gross salary less deduction and taxes) is the salary that an employee takes home. Also known as take-home pay, it is the amount an employee receives after taxes and other deductions. Therefore, the net salary differs from the gross salary because gross income doesn’t include tax deductions. On the contrary, the net income is the compensation after subtracting TDS, professional tax, and other company policy deductions.

Another important terminology is the gross salary; it is the basic pay plus other allowances, bonuses, and benefits.

**Difference between CTA and Take home salary**

While CTC is the total salary package of an employee, the in-hand salary is what’s left after all kinds of deductions. Thus, CTC reflects the total expenditure that an employer spends on an employee during a financial year. On the other hand, the in-hand salary is the amount the employee eventually gets after TDS and other deductions.

So to conclude, there is a difference between CTC written on offer letter and in hand salary written on the credit side of bank statement. So one should the complete knowledge of their tax deductions, other deductions etc., so that he can differentiate between CTC and in hand salary and save himself from undue disappointment at the time of salary credited into the bank.
